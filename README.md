Clockwork-Refresher
===================

Refreshing code for developers.

Install
===================

Put refresher into clockwork/plugins and gmsv_fsw_win32.dl into lua/bin.
The module is only required when you want the code to automatically refresh.

Usage
===================

When installed correctly any changes to the schema or plugins should be automatically applied.
When you didn't install the module, or are running linux, you can use the chat commands /schemareload and /pluginreload <string pluginname>.
The pluginname is the name of the folder (e.G. 'refresher')

This plugin isn't refreshing Clockwork core files.
